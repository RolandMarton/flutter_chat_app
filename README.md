# Flutter Chat Application

This is chat application made with Flutter with Firebase backend with various functionality. Users can log in, create accounts and chat in a single channel. Users also get notification about the messages.

Note: Project needs a working Firebase backend, and as I deleted mine so it's not working in this state. You need your own API key and project to run this app.
